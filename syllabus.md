## Overview
CSCI100 - Intro to Computer Science (aka CS0) is an introductory class designed for students with no formal exposure to computer science or programming. The goal is to provide a gentle but thorough introduction to computer science that will prepare students to either take further computer science courses, or use computer science in their field of study.

By the end of the course, students will learn
 - Variables, Expressions, Types
 - Input/Output
 - Logic and Control Flow
 - Functions
 - Testing, Asserts
 - Algorithms
 - Runtime and efficiency
 - Objects and Classes
 - Sets and Dictionaries

## Course Meetings
Lectures, labs, and office hours are the main ways in which you will interact with your professor and TAs. You can see the weekly schedule of course meetings on the [course schedule page](schedule.md). You must attend the lecture/lab time that you are assigned on bisonweb. 


Lecture and Lab Location: Mackey Building INNOV CTR.

| Section | Lecture| Lab |
|:-------------|:------|:------|
| Section 1 |  MW 9:10AM - 10:00AM | Thur 9:10AM - 10:00AM |
| Section 2 |  MW 10:10AM - 11:00AM | Thur 10:10AM - 11:00AM |
| Section 3 |  MW 2:10PM - 3:00PM | Thur 12:40PM - 1:30PM |

### Lecture
Lectures for this course will be 100% in-person. Classtime will be a mixture of lecturing, live-coding demos, group work and interactive discussions You are expected to come to each class as there will be weekly quizzes given at a random time during class based on previous class materials. 


### Labs
Lab for this course will be in person. Labs will allow you to apply the new concepts that you're learning in lecture to broader, graded problems. You will be given problems to solve, that you'll be able to work on with your peers in groups of 3-4. You must submit your labs individually and identify who you worked with. Labs will be submitted on Codio and graded by the Codio autograder. Labs will be released (INSERT LAB RELEASE SCHEDULE) 

You should take advantage of labs as you can ask the professor or TAs for help on completing the assignments. 

### Office Hours

We will hold a mixture of in-person and virtual office hours at a wide variety of times. Virtual office hours will be held on Zoom, the link can be found at the [course schedule page](schedule.md). In-person office hours will be held in Prof. Campbell's office. You are welcome to come for any reason, including course material questions, lecture clarifications, industry interview prep, career path discussions, or just to hang out. 

As a course, we commit to making sure no student fails the class due to lack of class resources, so if you are behind or confused, please reach out for help. The course staff will make themselves as available as possible to help you.

## Policies

### Grade Weighting

There will be two grading systems, both very similar, which will be applied to your work throughout the course. **Your final grade will be the greater of the two scores.** The intention here is for you to focus less on obtaining a certain grade. Instead you should focus on mastering and really understand the concepts that will be covered in this class. You will have many opportunities to demonstrate your understandings, hence the two grading systems. The two weighting systems are:

| Assignment Type | Weight in Overall Grade System 1 | Weight in Overall Grade System 2 |
|:-------------|:------|:------|
| Midterm Exam 1 |  7%  | 13% |
| Midterm Exam 2 | 12%  | 18% |
| Final Exam | 17% | 23% |
| Homeworks | 13% | 7% |
| Project 1 | 18% | 12% |
| Project 2 | 23% | 17% |
| Quizzes | 5% | 5% |
| Attendance | 5% | 5% |

### Assignments
These details are subject to change during the semester, however the current plan of record is the following:

- ~8 Quizzes - random during lecture time, once a week. 
- 12 Labs - 1x per week. Work w/ partners, submit individually
- 5 Homeworks - spread throughout the semester. Work individually, submit individually.
- 2 Projects - {INSERT PROJECTS}

Assignments will be due at 11:59pm, with a 10% penalty per each day that the assignment is late up to 5 days total.

### Exams
Instead of one midterm and one final exam, this course will have 3 exams, spaced evenly across the semester, with the third exam happening during finals week. Exam 1 will be {ADD DATE}. Exam 2 is will be on {ADD DATE}. Exam 3 will take place during finals week. 

### Cheating

For all assignments in the course, you may discuss approaches to solving a problem or work in the same room on separate computers to individually solve a problem, but **you may *not* copy and paste code or substantially copy ideas from another student**. It can be tempting to cheat. Know that Mimir's autograder has a very good plagiarism detector. Per Howard University policy, the first time an assignment is found to be plagiarized, the assignment grade will be zero-ed out for all students with matching code. The second time, all students involved will have their final course grade decreased by 1 letter grade (B going to a C, A- does to a B-, etc.). The third time, all students involved will be referred to the Dean's office for academic dishonesty. 

If I ask you how your code works and you do not know, it will be evident that you have copied it. Don't take the risk. Despite this explicit warning, each year, a few students still cheat and are caught. I do not enjoy catching and penalizing students for plagiarism, but it's necessary for 

The course staff will work tirelessly to provide enough support for any student to get help and make it through the class. In exchange, we ask you to uphold academic integrity and not to plagiarize code or ideas.

## Resources

This course website, [hucs0.org](https://www.hucs0.org), will be your one-stop resource for the syllabus, schedule, lecture videos, and assignment links. Additionally, we will be using the following software.

**Codio**
You will get a link to sign up for this tool when we begin class. We will use Codio for editing and turning in assignments. Note that Codio may display a “grade” for you, but the official one is in Blackboard.

**Piazza**
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. You can find the [class Piazza here](shortl.io/cs0-piazza){:target="_blank"}.

**Zoom**
In light of the large class size and COVID risks, our weekly lectures and labs will be taught virtually over Zoom. You can find the Zoom link for your section at [https://csci100.org/schedule/](https://hucs0.org/schedule/).

**Blackboard**
Your official class midterm and final grades will be published in Blackboard. You should already have a Blackboard account. Get in touch with your advisor if you can't access the course on Blackboard. Other than occasionally syncing grades to Blackboard, we will not be using Blackboard.
