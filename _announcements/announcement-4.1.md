#### **Reminders**

- Lab 2 is due **Wednesday September 11th at 11:59pm**. Dont forget to mark the assignment as complete
- Please submit Labs 1.1 and 1.2 if you have not done so already. They will be marked as complete automatically at 11:59pm September 10th
- Exam 1 will be on **Wednesday September 25th**. You'll receive a practice exam and review materials soon, but I recommend getting a head start on your studies
- Any questions you have about course material and content (like assignments) should be asked either in class, in office hours, or on Piazza. Please do not bombard your TAs' DMs as they likely will not respond
