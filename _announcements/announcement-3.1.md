**Reminder: Lab 1.1 and 1.2 are due TODAY at 11:59pm. Make sure that you mark the labs as complete when you're done so you don't incur a late penalty of 10%**

- Please make sure that you ask regarding assignments and course logistics on Piazza **first**. 
    - If you have a question, please make the post visible to **all instructors (not just me)** if you're question contains your code for a particular assignment. That way, you can get your questions answered more quickly
    - If you have a question that does not contain you code for a particular assignment, feel free to make the course public to everyone in the class if you're comfortable. You're also encouraged to answer questions that your peers ask on Piazza!
- Check the course website/Piazza regularly as most of your course related questions are answered
