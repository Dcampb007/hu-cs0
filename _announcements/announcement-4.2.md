#### **Announcements**
- **Lab 2 has been extended**
  - Lab 2 will be due on Wednesday, September 18th at 11:59 pm. Continue to ask questions on Piazza and attend office hours
- **There will be no quiz tomorrow**
   - To ensure that students have a really good grasp on conditionals and while loops, we'll spend Wednesday's lecture practicing a little more with it.

I will be in my office (LKD 1110G) from 9am to 5pm today (9/10) so feel free to drop by any time with questions.

Happy learning!
