## Supplemental Learning Tools
Hi class!

Here's a list of extra materials that you can use to practice your coding skills and understanding of the material taught in class:

### Coding practice
- [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com)
- [CodeWars](https://codewars.com)
    - **Note**  When you sign up, focus on doing 8 kyu problems, and after signing up, where it says "Your next challenge", change the focus to fundamentals.
- [PracticePython](https://www.practicepython.org/)
- [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-exercises-practice-questions-and-solutions/)
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
    - **Note:** Leetcode can have a bit of a tricky way of setting difficulty, so some of their "easy" problems aren't as easy for absolute beginners (All the links above this one are a a bit better at this). I reccommend taking a look at [this list](https://dev.to/snj/leetcode-problems-for-beginners-5enm) and doing the questions under "Strings" for now
