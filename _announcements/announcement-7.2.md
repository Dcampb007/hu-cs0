#### **Internship Opportunities Geared Towards First/Second-Year Students**

Happy new month y'all!

As recruitment season is well underway, I want to make sure that you all have a list of companies that have
internship programs geared towards first and second year students. While I strongly recommend Google as a place
to work as a current employee and former intern, I also recommend applying to different places so you can have options!
Below is a list of companies that are actively accepting applications. I will add to this list over time, so check back
here regularly! **Note: All internships I list here accept international students and provide visa sponsorships. They are also all paid $$$!**
