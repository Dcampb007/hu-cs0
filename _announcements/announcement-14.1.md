#### Things to do:
* Be on the lookout for a practice exam! It will be posted on Piazza this week :)

#### Updates:

* Final exam logistics:
  1. Exam will be on Dec 7th, 7-9PM virtual. All sections will be at the same time.
  1. Who is exempt from taking the Final Exam?
    1. Students that received a 90% on both Exam 1 and Exam 2
    1. Students that have a 95% in the class before the final exam
  1. When will you know that you have to take the final exam?
    We will update the gradebook on Dec 2nd. So Dec 3rd you'll know whether you have to take the exam or not. In order for this to happen, ALL assignments will be due on Nov 29th!

* All assignments have been reopened. The absolute last day to submit work is November 29th at 11:59PM. Please read the following rules carefully:
  1. These assignments are open for re-submission for those that want to achieve a higher letter grade in this class. Please make sure to fill out the [regrade submission form](http://www.shortl.io/cs0-grading-request-form){:target="_blank"} once you've redone your assignments.
  1. Note: If are exempt from the final or are satisfied with your grade in the class, I ask that you **DO NOT fill out the regrade submission form**. This will lighten the workload for my TAs who are also studying for finals.
