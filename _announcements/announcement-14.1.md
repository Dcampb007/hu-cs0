### Reminder: Come to Class Today
Good morning y'all,

This is a reminder to **please come to class today** as we will be doing a post-assessment of the things you've learned over the last 14 weeks. This will be the same as the pre-assessment that you took at the beginning of the semester.

Also, [this post-semester survey](http://goo.gle/GIR2024-PostSurvey) form will be worth a free extra lab if you fill it out. It'll take less than 20 minutes.
