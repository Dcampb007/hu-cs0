#### **Announcements**

- **Lab 3 will be due Friday, September 27th at 11:59pm**
  - Make sure you mark the assignment as complete when you're done. Forgetting to do so will not count as a valid excuse. Continue to ask questions on Piazza and attend office hours
- **The first of Google's 6-week Tech Series will be Thursday, September 25th**
   - Please try to come to this virtual event if you can make it. The topic will be on **Software Engineering**

6PM-7PM ET

- For the exam Wednesday, **make sure you come to class EARLY**. The exam will close automatically at the end of your assigned lecture time, and coming to class late is not a valid excuse for not completing the exam

- All the questions from the review session today are under the schedule for this week

- As a reminder, I will have office hours tomorrow (9/24) from 11-3. If there is anything you need to chat about, please feel free to drop by
