#### **Announcments**

Hi class!

Quick announcement: **Lecture on Monday, October 7th will be virtual.** You may access the course zoom [here](https://howard.zoom.us/j/3327295328?pwd=TEFxUUI1UmRXcEpSSnp5V04rc2swZz09). I'll keep reminding you this week!

Also, as holiday breaks are coming soon, a few announcements regarding Thanksgiving break and finals.

- Lecture on **Monday, November 25th** will be **optional and virtual**. Since it's the last week of class, lecture on Monday will just be review for the final exam
- Lecture on **Wednesday, November 27th** will be **cancelled**
- I've updated the [syllabus](https://hucs0.org/syllabus/#exams) to reflect the final exam schedule so that you can plan any winter break travel accordingly.
