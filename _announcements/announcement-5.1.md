#### **Announcements**

- **Remember to complete lab 2 by Wednesday, September 18th**
  - Make sure you mark the assignment as complete when you're done. Forgetting to do so will not count as a valid excuse. Continue to ask questions on Piazza and attend office hours
- **There is a study guide for exam 1 available on Codio**
   - Please take the time to take a look at it. It's not graded, but will help you in terms of studying
