Hello Students,

Week 0, Labs 1.1, 1.2, and HW0 are now open on Codio.

Week 0 assignments  are just to get you familiar with the Codio environment and won’t take long. ***Lab 1.1 and 1.2*** are also available. You can work on these individually or in random groups (Preferred) during lab time tomorrow. The TAs and I will be on the call to pop into breakout rooms and answer any questions you may have.

***HW0*** is to be done alone, because it's about you :).

The ***Unix Commands Assignment*** is for your reference, but I STRONGLY recommend doing it, so you’re familiar with running commands in the terminal (which you will be doing a lot in your matriculation).

Please make sure to mark the assignment as Complete when you're done to indicate that it's ready to be graded.

If you’re not signed up for Codio, please do it before the lab tomorrow. [www.shortl.io/cs0-codio](www.shortl.io/cs0-codio)
