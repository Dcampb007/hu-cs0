#### **Announcments**

Hi class!

 - Due to the university changes during election week, I've decided to push back the exam. It will now be held on **Wednesday, November 13th** during class time

 - Remember that lab 6 is due **today**, lab 7 is due **Friday** and the project code submission is due **next Monday**

 - The last day to withdraw from a course is **next Friday November 8th**. If you have under a 60 in this class, I'd have a conversation with your advisor about whether or not it'd be worth taking this class next semester.
