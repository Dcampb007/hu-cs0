I am a junior Computer Science major from Kingston, Jamaica. Iâ€™m very active on campus and can often be found participating in organizations like HU IPals and the Senate. My favorite language is Python, and I recently spent my summer interning at Microsoft, working on the OneDrive and SharePoint Team! My motto is 'No question is a dumb question,' so feel free to contact me anytime for help.
