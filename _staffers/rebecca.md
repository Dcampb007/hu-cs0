I’ve been a Software Engineer at Google for 8 years. After about 6 years in the Bay Area, I decided to move back to the east coast and currently live in Alexandria, VA. I have a Master’s in Education and I’m particularly passionate about CS education. In my free time, I enjoy reading & writing, watching sports, and playing with my dog.
