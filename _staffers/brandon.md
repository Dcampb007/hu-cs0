I am a sophomore computer science major and intending math or physics minor from Montegobay, Jamaica. I love to code in python, but I also enjoy creating personal projects with C++, python, and java. I spend my free time playing games, going out on adventures with friends and family, and expanding my knowledge culturally, tech-wise, and on investing. My favorite dessert is ice-cream and cheesecake.
