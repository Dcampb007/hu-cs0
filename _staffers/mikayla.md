Just like Professor Campbell I too am a Howard alum (â„… 2021). I grew up in Georgia, and after college I moved to the Bay Area to do my current role as a Software Engineer working on Google Maps. In my spare time, I really enjoy listening to podcasts like The Wellness Cafe and This American Life, as well as binge watching Netflix shows
