I graduated from Howard University in 2019 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science. I am a software engineer at Google, working on [Zanzibar](https://zanzibar.academy/), Google's globally distributed authorization system. Before coming to Google fulltime I was a 3x intern at the company, so yeah Google is all I know üòÅ. I'm super excited to be back in Washington DC teaching at my alma mater this fall. I've volunteered in many nonprofits with a focus on increasing opportunities for black people in tech. In my free time I like to play jazz music on my saxophone.
