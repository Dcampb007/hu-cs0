I am a sophomore Computer Science major and Math minor from Kathmandu, Nepal. I love music, soccer and working out, and I recently tripped off a well-functioning airplane from 13k feet. My strongest language is Python, and I coded in Java throughout the summer. Feel free to reach out to me and/or drop by my office hours to talk about anything youâ€™d like.
