Hi everyone! I’m Courtney, a sophomore Computer Science major from Shawnee, Kansas (and yes, I know, “we’re not in Kansas anymore” 😂). I enjoy programming in Python and Java; I know C++ but can’t say I enjoy it. I love exploring cities and parks, reading fiction, eating ice cream, and watching bad television. I look forward to getting to know you all so feel free to reach out!
