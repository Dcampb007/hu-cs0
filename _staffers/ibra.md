Hi, I'm Ibra originally from Albania living in Sunnyvale, CA. I'm a Site Reliability Engineer at Google. Together wth my team we work on making sure that most of Google's sharing and identity services such as Profiles, Notifications, etc. run smoothly. I'm excited to be working with everyone at Howard this semester and look forward to help you throughout the course!
