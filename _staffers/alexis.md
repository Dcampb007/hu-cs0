Hello! My name is Alexis Evans, and I'm a sophomore computer science major, mathematics minor from Ann Arbor, MI. This summer, I was a STEP intern at Google in Mountain View, and I am also a part of Break Through Tech, a program that teaches underrepresented women fundamentals of machine learning engineering. I'm excited to help you all out this semester, and if you have any questions about the class, Howard, or something else, please don't hesitate to reach out. The best way to contact me is my Howard email address, alexis.evans@bison.howard.edu.
