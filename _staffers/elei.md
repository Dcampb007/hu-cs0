Hi! My first name is Mary but I prefer to go by my middle name Elei. I'm a sophomore computer science major, psychology minor from Nigeria. I love music and dancing so I took some hip hop and street dancing classes at Google during my internship this past summer. I enjoy getting to know people and I look forward to working with you all this semester!
