Hi, I'm Kevin, graduated from University of Maryland, and I'm located in Mountain View, CA as a Software Engineer at Google. I work on the Play Doc Infra team, working on ingestion and serving data for Apps reviews and user generated content. I'm glad to be here to help with the course, and look forward to this semester.
