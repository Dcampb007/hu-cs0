Hey everyone! My name is Nicasio. I am a junior Computer Science major from Trinidad and Tobago. I am a huge fan of robotics and am currently the Treasurer of the Howard University Robotics Organization, so I encourage all of you to join! I love listening to music so feel free to throw me any recommendations.
I look forward to working with you all this semester and answering any questions you may have.
