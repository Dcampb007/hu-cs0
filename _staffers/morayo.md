My name is Morayo Adeyemi, a computer science major and mathematics minor from the Chicago area. During my freshman year, I interned as a STEP Software Engineer at Google, where I developed a validating backend database for Google Ads clients. In my sophomore year, I conducted research at Stanford University, focusing on computer vision and machine learning for wearable technology. I also participated in Google’s Tech Exchange in spring 2024. I currently serve as your Vice President of the CEA Student Council and conduct research in Howard's Natural Language Processing lab. I'm also a TA for CSCI 470, so feel free to ask me about theory or cool CS algorithms. I was the Director of BisonBytes, Howard’s first CS hackathon, and I really recommend you try out hackathons! They are a great way to learn and apply really fast! My big goal is to pursue a PhD in computer vision and graphics, so I’m also happy to help with any research or graduate school-related questions!
