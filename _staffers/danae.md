Hello, my name is Danae Dunlap and I am a junior computer science major from Las Vegas, Nevada. During my time at Howard, I have had the honor of participating in the Google Tech Exchange Program, joining several STEM related extracurriculars, and successfully completing two summers  at Amazon as a software engineer. When I graduate, I hope to become a software developer for a non-profit organization or NGO dedicated to helping those in need. I'm exciting to get to know you all throughout the semester and the rest of our time as Bison!
